# Open on Gist

Provides commands to quickly view the current file on gist.github.com, if the current repository is [cloned from a GitHub Gist](https://help.github.com/articles/forking-and-cloning-gists/). Inspired by the [Open on GitHub](https://github.com/atom/open-on-github) package.

Activate with `Open on Gist: Current Project`.
